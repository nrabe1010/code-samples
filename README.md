## Exercise

1. In code, get all the words within the [sample data](words.json) into an object or data structure that you can manipulate
2. Record the number of characters for every unique word (case insensitive) within the "words" key in the sample data
4. Classify each word into two categories based on word length, whether the number of characters in the word is an odd number or not
5. Sort the resulting words from step 3 according to the number of characters in each of them, from least to greatest
6. Print the final output of the above steps.
7. Please include a README.md on how we can run your code and tests.
